capstone project ideas

Dataset/source/issue/deliverable

Chicago crime statistics/CPD/Can crime class and location be predicted?/Lower crime in the city
Microbiome-Amazon data set/Can bacteria types be classified according to anatomical site in health?
vaccination rates-WHO/vaccination and disease rates/Can vaccination rates predict disease rates?

These are three working capstone project ideas

I think the Microbiome data set will require the least data wrangling, I cannot access the dataset with my current skill set.

Can you help me access this dataset?  I am not sure this is the dataset I want to commit to for my capstone.  I do need a dataset to start working with in R to familiarize myself.  

I finished R intermediate this week and began statistical refreshers and ggplot tutorials on DataCamp

Goals for this next week
1.  Finish ggplot tutorials on Datacamp
2.  Finish statistical refreshers and feel confident in basic statistics
3.  Access data set and begin writing code to analyze dataset
